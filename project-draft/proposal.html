            <h2>Problem Description</h2>
            <p>Trading cards have become an increasingly popular hobby with digital marketplaces providing a foundation for communities to interact with each other and expand to those interested. Without a centralized market and platform to standardize information, however, buying and selling cards makes it difficult for collectors to access a wide range of cards and for sellers to reach potential buyers. The current marketplace, moreover, is often difficult to navigate and nearly impossible to verify the authenticity of both cards and users; this information problem leads to challenges for buyers and sellers which then hinders the development of these communities. 
                Buyers have to research through multiple platforms to find information on cards and marketplace authenticity, while sellers struggle to reach potential buyers and advertise information on a centralized platform. 
                Existing platforms such as <a href="https://ebay.com">eBay</a> and <a href="https://TCGplayer.com">TCGplayer</a> allow for buyer and seller interaction but lack information on who owned the cards, and on which people are looking for that type of card. To address these challenges, we will devise an application platform to develop a comprehensive trading card marketplace and integrate necessary features to resolve these information problems. 
                Through scalping and integrating existing datasets like this <a href="https://github.com/fferegrino/yu-gi-oh/tree/main/data">Yu-Gi-Oh! Dataset</a> we are able to develop a solution that resolves these information problems. This platform will offer a centralized location for buyers and sellers to access essential information, including authentication, card history, and pricing data.

            <h2>Proposed Application Description</h2>
            <p>The app we want to make is a trading marketplace for cards that caters more towards user-to-user interactions. It’s directed towards people who want to buy or sell cards, but also should be easy for those who are new to cards to interact with. This way, people who aren’t very familiar with cards but want to sell something their late relative left them, would be able to easily navigate and sell the cards.</p>
            <p>The main use for this app is to help card collectors connect to more easily buy and sell cards. We plan on having lots of features similar to a social media app, but more restrictive so it doesn’t become a social media platform. Users can make posts, either posting a card they want to sell, or post a “Looking For” post that lets other users know that they’re searching for a specific card, in case someone has it and wants to sell it. We intend to implement a chat feature that allows users to interact and negotiate with each other. As far as transactions go, we're unsure how or if we can implement that, so we're considering it as a possible feature for now. Another feature we will have is a search feature that lets users search for cards based on name and possibly by tags. We also want to allow users to have a profile that has an inventory of all cards they have for sale, along with ratings given by other users that shows trustworthiness. The last possible features we would have are an explore page / feed that lets users see cards for sale that could relate to them and a possible card history page, that show previous owners of a specific card. We may think of other ideas over the quarter, but this is our base app for now. Below is a list of the features we will implement, as well as another list of ideas we had for smaller, possible features.</p>
            <p>The main problem we aim to solve with this application is user-to-user interaction among card collectors and collectors reaching an audience that relates to cards, rather than a centralized audience. The app will help solve these issues by first and foremost, being an app solely for buying and selling cards. This eliminates the other audiences who aren’t interested. The app’s chat feature also solves the issue of convenient user interaction. Users will be able to easily contact one another and negotiate prices or card trades directly through the app, while also allowing for more connections and friendships revolving around a common hobby.</p>
